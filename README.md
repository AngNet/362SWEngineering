# 362SWEngineering
This group project is put together by 5 CS students for our CPSC 362 (Software Engineering) Course. Our project is an inventory web application made with python and flask. The work was split up by having 5 people focus on the back end python program and then another person works to develop the front end user interface.

## Getting Started
To get started, you need to download the folder labeled "FrontEndFiles" and the myflaskapp.sql file. The FrontEndFiles contains the python file combined with flask, all the html files, and pictures used in the website.

### Prerequisites
In order for the program to work, you need to download Python on your computer. This project was mainly done in linux, thus the instructions are for linux users. To check what python version you have, type:

```
python -V
```
What's recommending for downloading python libraries is by using pip. To download pip, type in:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

With pip installed, the python libraries you need to download for this are: Flask-WTF, passlib, flask-mysqldb, and flask. An example to download a library with pip is as followed:
```
pip install Flask-WTF
```

### Running the app 

```
python app.py
```

## Built With
